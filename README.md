# MAS220Project
To run this project three external libraries need to be downloaded and included:

DAC: https://github.com/solnor/DAC
motorLib: https://github.com/solnor/motorLib
Queue: https://github.com/solnor/Queue

These libraries can be included into the Arduino IDE after downloading by clicking on Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .ZIP Library and selecting the zipped folder downloaded.

An external power supply of 12V is needed to drive the DC- and stepper motor.
